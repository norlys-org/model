Specification


                            2. SPECIFICATION

2.1 Technologies
  
  It has been decided to write the model in Rust as it is has good 
  oberservability over the memory usage. 
  Another factor is the good support of WebAssembly. With WebAssembly
  it is therefore easy to deploy to either a V8 backend, or to the 
  Internet Computer directly.
